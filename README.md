# student-performance-analysis
This project analyzes student academic performance data to identify trends between study habits and exam results. Using Python and data analysis libraries, the project processes and visualizes educational data to generate meaningful insights. A simple rule-based method is used to classify students as Pass or Fail based on their marks
# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student academic performance using Python. The goal is to understand how study hours and attendance affect marks and to identify pass/fail outcomes.
